# Calendar

## Friday 1 September ##

We started the project by creating the **Github repository**, a **kanvan board**, and the **project in VS**.
Next, we brainstorm to start shaping the project.
* We assign the first tasks
    * Ian and Aday will do the main calendar display
    * Enric starts with createNewTask modal form
    * Amina has not attended

Now we have to create the branches in which we are going to work and start
The first problems arise when considering how to organize the main view of the calendar and how to organize the days and their information.

## Monday 4 September ##

* Amina was rejoined and assigned a few tasks with Enric. 
* They made the title and descriptions's regex with a max lenght. 
* Meanwhile, Aday e Yan were doing the calendar display. 
* Yan does a lot of research of how can we put the days of the month.
