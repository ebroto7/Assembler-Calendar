# Calendar

## Viernes 1 octubre ##

We started the project by creating the **Github repository**, a **kanvan board**, and the **project in VS**.
Next, we brainstorm to start shaping the project.
* We assign the first tasks
    * Ian will do the main calendar display
    * Aday
    * Enric
    * Amina has not attended

Now we have to create the branches in which we are going to work and start
