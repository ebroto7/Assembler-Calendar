# Calendar

## Friday 1 September ##

We started the project by creating the **Github repository**, a **kanvan board**, and the **project in VS**.
Next, we brainstorm to start shaping the project.
* We assign the first tasks
    * Ian and Aday will do the main calendar display
    * Enric starts with createNewTask modal form
    * Amina has not attended

Now we have to create the branches in which we are going to work and start


## Monday 4 September ##

* Amina was rejoined and assigned a few tasks with Enric. 
* They made the title and descriptions's regex with a max lenght. 
* Meanwhile, Aday e Ian were doing the calendar display. 
* Ian does a lot of research of how can we put the days of the month.

## Tuesday 5th September

*
    * Amina sidebar
    * Enric Local storage form
    * Aday and Ian continues working with main calendar display and functionalities of it.
The first problems arise when considering how to organize the main view of the calendar and how to organize the days and their information.

## Tuesday 6th September

* Amina sidebar 
* Enric local storage form but he needs to create a new one from 0
* Ian continues working with main calendar display and functionalities of it. ( Days id, motnh id, selected day of today remarcable.)
* Aday, help ian, save in storage form and a try of an interval checkbox.
* Meanwhile, Aday e Yan were doing the calendar display. 
* Yan does a lot of research of how can we put the days of the month.



## Thuesday 7 September ##

* Enric has worked with the form again, as some errors need to be corrected (when the form is closed it does not crush the entered values, therefore when the modal is reopened they are still there). After several attempts he manages to solve it with a reset function.
On the other hand, it also means that depending on which button calls the modal, we can pass certain information as a parameter so that it can be entered into its inputs.

* Aday make styles, and start working with interval
