# Calendar

## Friday 1 September ##

We started the project by creating the **Github repository**, a **kanvan board**, and the **project in VS**.
Next, we brainstorm to start shaping the project.
* We assign the first tasks
    * Ian and Aday will do the main calendar display
    * Enric starts with createNewTask modal form
    * Amina has not attended

Now we have to create the branches in which we are going to work and start


## Monday 4 September ##

* Amina was rejoined and assigned a few tasks with Enric. 
* They made the title and descriptions's regex with a max lenght. 
* Meanwhile, Aday e Ian were doing the calendar display.
